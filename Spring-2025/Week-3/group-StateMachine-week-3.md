## 🏆 Accomplishments
- Started discussions on the state machine.
- Created an initial diagram for the state machine, tasks, and image processing.

## 🚧 Challenges
- We initially struggled synchronizing everyone's draw.io. Some of us were unable to view colors that help organize our design. 

## 🛠 Solutions
- The solution we found was that draw.io only sets colors to whatever mode you are using. So if one member is using light mode (for whatever reason) they will not view the same colors for those using dark mode.

## 📚 Resources
- (I think the link works idk) https://app.diagrams.net/#G1K-_OLwYVlFx8v0XepHUBJz2EnbRL6MF2#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22ZPf1p-95Dl-G6NqpWSGb%22%7D

## 🎯 Next Week’s Goals
- Define the API for inputs and outputs to the state machine. 
- Start working on the code for tasks.
- Start defining the general structure in code.

## 🔍 Additional Notes
- Diagrams are in the Software channel on discord
